# DBCrack

## A reverse-hashing program

DISCLAIMER: This was a project just for fun and I have no intention of making this into putting lots of time into this.

The purpose of this is to import a wordlist in which it will import the words into a database. After that it will hash the database in 4 different hashes currently: MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and SHA512. Then the actuall attack is to compare the hash will the entire database.
